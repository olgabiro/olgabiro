# 👋 Hi there, I'm a fullstack developer who talks to computers (and occasionally humans) for a living.

🧠 **Professionally**:
- 🔧 Fullstack developer (aka: backend dev who accidentally learned CSS)
- ☕ Java wizard – main expertise, main caffeine source
- 💼 Kotlin & Angular sidekick in the corporate trenches
- 💪 Strongly typed language fan. If the compiler isn't yelling, did you even code?

🧸 **Off the Clock**:
- 🐍 Python for the giggles
- 🎮 Unity explorer, trying to turn bugs into features
- 🌱 Currently learning Svelte
